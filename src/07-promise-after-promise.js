/*
## Task

This task will allow you to demonstrate an understanding how to chain promises
together using then.

Call first function in your program. first() will return a promise that
will be fulfilled with a secret value.

Call second with the fulfilled value of first. Return the promise returned
by second in your onFulfilled callback.

Finally, print the fulfilled value of that new promise with console.log.
*/

var firstPromise = first();
var secondPromise = firstPromise.then(function (val) {
  return second(val);
});

secondPromise.then(console.log);
